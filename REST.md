# REST API

For clients who do not wish to take advantage of CoinFLEX's native [WebSocket API][], CoinFLEX offers a RESTful API that implements much of the same functionality.

## Authentication

Authenticated requests to the REST API use [HTTP Basic Authentication][], wherein the *user-id* is the concatenation of user's numeric ID, a slash, and the user's Base64-encoded API key, and the *password* is the user's password or the Base64 encoding of the user's 28-byte private key that is derived from the user's ID and password.

The public market data methods do not require authentication.
